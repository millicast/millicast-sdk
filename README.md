This Software Development Kit (SDK) for JavaScript allows developers to simplify Millicast services integration into their own web apps.

## Installation
You can use the CDN version of the SDK adding this tag to your document's `<head>`. Then `millicast` global variable will be available to use it.
```html
<script src='https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/npm/@millicast/sdk@latest/dist/millicast.umd.js'></script>
```

Or if you are building an application with Node.js, you can install the SDK package to your dependencies.


```sh
$ npm i --save @millicast/sdk
```

## Basic Usage
This simple example will show how to broadcast the user camera and microphone to Millicast Media Servers and viewing it.

You will need a Millicast account and a valid publishing token that you can find it in your dashboard ([link here](https://dash.millicast.com/#/signin)).


### Publisher app


```javascript
import { Director, Publish } from '@millicast/sdk'
//Define callback for generate new tokens
const tokenGenerator = () => Director.getPublisher('my-publishing-token', 'my-stream-name')

//Create a new instance
const millicastPublish = new Publish(streamName, tokenGenerator)

//Get User camera and microphone
const mediaStream = await navigator.mediaDevices.getUserMedia({ audio: true, video: true })

//Publishing Options
const broadcastOptions = {
  mediaStream
}

//Start broadcast
try {
  await millicastPublish.connect(broadcastOptions)
} catch (e) {
  console.log('Connection failed, handle error', e)
}
```


### Viewer app

`index.html`
```html
<html>
<head>
  ...
</head>
<body>
  <video id="my-video"></video>
  
  <script src='viewer.js'></script>
</body>
</html>
```
`viewer.js`
```javascript
import { Director, View } from '@millicast/sdk'

//Define callback for generate new token
const tokenGenerator = () => Director.getSubscriber('my-stream-name', 'my-account-id')

//Create a new instance
const millicastView = new View(streamName, tokenGenerator)

//Set event handler for receive stream from publisher and add it to your <video> tag
millicastView.on('track', (event) => {
  const video = document.getElementById('my-video')
  video.srcObject = event.streams[0]
})

//Start connection to publisher
try {
  await millicastView.connect()
} catch (e) {
  console.log('Connection failed, handle error', e)
}
```
