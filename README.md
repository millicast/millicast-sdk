This Software Development Kit (SDK) for JavaScript allows developers to simplify Millicast services integration into their own web apps.

## Installation
You can use the CDN version of the SDK adding this tag to your document's `<head>`. Then `millicast` global variable will be available to use it.
```html
<script src='https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/npm/@millicast/sdk@latest/dist/millicast.umd.js'></script>
```

Or if you are building an application with Node.js, you can install the SDK package to your dependencies.


```sh
npm i --save @millicast/sdk
```

## Basic Usage

The following examples demonstrate how to broadcast with the Publisher app capturing the user's camera and microphone. You can then view the stream using the Viewer app.

You will need to use a [Dolby Millicast account](https://streaming.dolby.io/) with a valid publishing token.

### Publisher app

Please be sure to set up the credentials filling up the `yourStreamName` and `yourPublishingToken` fields.

In vanilla JavaScript:

`publisher.html`

```html
<html>
  <head>
    <!-- Import the Millicast JS SDK -->
    <script src="https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/npm/@millicast/sdk@latest/dist/millicast.umd.js"></script>
  </head>

  <body>
    <script type="module">
      const yourPublishingToken = "..."
      const yourStreamName = "..."

      // Define callback for generate new tokens
      const tokenGenerator = () => millicast.Director.getPublisher({
        token: yourPublishingToken,
        streamName: yourStreamName
      })

      // Create a new instance
      const millicastPublish = new millicast.Publish(yourStreamName, tokenGenerator)

      // Get user camera and microphone
      const mediaStream = await navigator.mediaDevices.getUserMedia({ audio: true, video: true })

      // Publishing options
      const broadcastOptions = {
        mediaStream
      }

      // Start broadcast
      try {
        await millicastPublish.connect(broadcastOptions)
      } catch (e) {
        console.log('Connection failed, handle error', e)
      }
    </script>
  </body>
</html>
```


### Viewer app

Please be sure to set up the credentials filling up the `yourStreamName` and `yourStreamAccountId` fields.

In vanilla JavaScript:

`viewer.html`

```html
<html>
  <head>
    <!-- Import the Millicast JS SDK -->
    <script src="https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/npm/@millicast/sdk@latest/dist/millicast.umd.js"></script>
  </head>

  <body>
    <video id="my-video" controls autoplay muted></video>

    <script type="module">
      // Get media element
      const video = document.getElementById('my-video')

      // Set the credentials for the streaming
      const yourStreamName = "..."
      const yourStreamAccountId = "..."

      // Define callback for generate new token
      const tokenGenerator = () => millicast.Director.getSubscriber({
        streamName: yourStreamName,
        streamAccountId: yourStreamAccountId
      })

      // Create a new instance
      const millicastView = new millicast.View(yourStreamName, tokenGenerator, video)

      // Start connection to publisher
      try {
        await millicastView.connect()
      } catch (e) {
        console.log('Connection failed, handle error', e)
      }
    </script>
  </body>
</html>
```

## Documentation

The [Documentation](https://docs.dolby.io/streaming-apis/docs/introduction-to-streaming-apis) provides an overview of the Dolby Millicast services. This includes a [Getting Started](https://docs.dolby.io/streaming-apis/docs/getting-started) guide as a quick start.

The [SDK Documentation](https://millicast.github.io/millicast-sdk/) details the Modules, Classes, and APIs you can use during development. 

### Samples

There are several packages that implement a publisher and viewer. These samples can be run and inspected for examples of how to implement various features.

## JS Frameworks

This section is intended to explain how properly integrate this SDK with different JS frameworks, with links to official guides that will contain a more step by step oriented explanation on how to do it. 

Right now, we only have a React Native guide.

### React Native
This SDK can be used for React Native based projects. In order to accomplish this integration, some configuration steps are needed. This library assumes all webRTC methods are natively defined (usually, inside web browsers). However this is not the case for native Android/iOS native applications. In order to solve this, we have tested and worked along with [React Native webRTC project](https://github.com/react-native-webrtc/react-native-webrtc) for this purpose. 

Check out this guide on [how to integrate Millicast JS SDK with React Native webRTC](https://docs.dolby.io/streaming-apis/docs/rn)!
