# Millicast Viewer Demo

The Viewer demo application demonstrates playback capability that you can add to your application using the Millicast SDK. You can use it to experience and test receiving high-value content with ultra-low latency.

## Getting started

1. Go to the [Dolby.io Streaming dashboard](https://dashboard.dolby.io/) and select your token. If you do not have a token, create it by clicking the **create** button.

2. Locate your `account ID` in the **token details** tab and copy the token.

3. Select the **publishing** tab and copy your `stream name`.

4. Open the Millicast SDK in a code editor, create a `.env` file in the `millicast-viewer-demo` folder, and add the following data to the file: 

```sh
MILLICAST_STREAM_NAME=yourStreamName
MILLICAST_ACCOUNT_ID=yourAccountId
```

This content is also available in the `.env.sample` file.

5. Replace `yourStreamName` and `yourAccountId` with the data copied from the dashboard.

6. Open a terminal in the `millicast-viewer-demo` folder.

7. Install all dependencies:
```sh
npm ci
```
8. Run the application:
```sh
npm start
```

9. Open `http://localhost:10002` and test the application.

To receive a stream, you need to broadcast it first. You can do it either via the Dolby.io dashboard by clicking the **broadcast** button, located next to your token, or you can use the [Publisher](../millicast-publisher-demo/) demo application. After you start broadcasting, the Viewer application will be able to play the streamed content.

## Introducing updates
After introducing any changes to the `public` directory, use the following command:
```
