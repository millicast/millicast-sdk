11. MISCELLANEOUS. This Agreement is the entire agreement between you and Millicast, and
supersedes any and all prior agreements, negotiations, or other communications between
you and Millicast, whether oral or written, with respect to the subject matter hereof,
and, except as expressly provided herein, cannot be modified except in writing signed by
both parties. In the event that any provision of this Agreement is held to be invalid or
unenforceable, then: (a) such provision shall be deemed reformed to the extent strictly
necessary to render such provision valid and enforceable, or if not capable of such
reformation shall be deemed severed from this Agreement; and (b) the validity and
enforceability of all of the other provisions hereof, shall in no way be affected or
impaired thereby. You may not assign this Agreement without the prior written consent of
Millicast, whether expressly or by operation of law, including in connection with a
merger or change of control, and any such attempted assignment shall be void and of no
effect. Millicast may assign this Agreement without restriction and without any notice to
you. Subject to the foregoing, this Agreement shall be binding on the parties and their
respective successors and permitted assigns. You acknowledge and understand that if
Millicast is unable to provide the SDK as a result of a force majeure event Millicast
will not be in breach of this Agreement. A force majeure event means any event beyond the
control of Millicast. The failure to exercise, or delay in exercising, a right, power or
remedy provided in this Agreement or by law shall not constitute a waiver of that right,
power or remedy. Millicast's waiver of any obligation or breach of this Agreement shall
not operate as a waiver of any other obligation or subsequent breach of the Agreement.
The English language version of this Agreement shall be the official and controlling
version, and any translation provided is solely for convenience. The SDK is a "Commercial
Item" as that term is defined at 48 C.F.R. 2.101, consisting of "Commercial Computer
Software" and "Commercial Computer Software Documentation." If and to the extent the SDK
is supplied to or purchased by or on behalf of a United States government entity or an
entity licensing the SDK for or on behalf of a United States government entity, the SDK
is licensed (a) only as a Commercial Item and (b) with only those rights as are granted
to all other end users pursuant to the terms and conditions of this agreement.
